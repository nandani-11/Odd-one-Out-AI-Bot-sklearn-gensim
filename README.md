Teaching English to your AI Bot
You are making an AI Bot which can speak English. You want to add
another functionality to it which helps the bot to find out the 'odd word' in a
given list of words. Devise an algorithms using Word Embeddings to do the
same.
Hint :-
Find out the cosine similarity of each word embedding from the average
vector obtained from all of word embeddings.
Data Format
There is no training data. You can download Glove 6B.50.txt embeddings
from the internet.
The input file contains a list of words. For each row, make a prediction
about the odd one and write the output in a new CSV file.
